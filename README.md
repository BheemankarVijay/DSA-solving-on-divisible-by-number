# DSA-solving-on-divisible-by-number
solving DSA problems on Divisible by number  which solving worst case and best time complexity. Best Case Time Complexity:  𝑂 ( 1 ) for single-digit number.Worst Case Time Complexity:  𝑂 ( log ⁡ 10 ( 𝑛 ) ) , which is more efficient than the  𝑂 ( 𝑛 )  complexity.
